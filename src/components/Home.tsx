      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! One of the most popular resources for TTRPG world-building
        among GMs is the excellent book{" "}
        <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348791/worlds-without-number">
          <em>Worlds Without Number</em>
        </a>{" "}
        by the brilliant{" "}
        <a href="https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/pages/about-us">
          Kevin Crawford
        </a>
        . While itâ€™s an incredible TTRPG in its own right (and definitely worth
        checking out), its GM-focused content is among the best in the industry.
        A generous free version, containing 90% of the content, is also
        available{" "}
        <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition">

        .

        Iâ€™m a huge fan of the random tables in this book. Most of them are
        system-agnostic, and Crawford even encourages using the world-building
        content for other systems (see page 220). I created this website to make
        using these random tables simpler and faster, helping GMs focus on
        building fantastic worlds and RPG settings.

        I primarily made this website for myself, but I figured others might
        find it useful as well. The code for the website can be found{" "}

          here

        and the code is open source under the{" "}

        . If you notice any issues feel free to open up an issue on GitHub and I
        will do my best to take a look (but no promises, I am a full time
        software engineer and dad ðŸ™‚).

      <h2>Usage Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Open the menu in the sidebar and select a category. On first opening the
        page, random results will be rolled on each table. Clicking the
        "refresh" button will refresh all table results
      </p>
      <img style={{ border: "1px solid black" }} src={tutorialOne}></img>
      <p>
        Each bolded bullet point is the header for one of the tables found in
        the book. Clicking any of the individual table headers will reroll just
        that table.
