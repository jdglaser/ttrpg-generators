      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! One of the most popular resources for TTRPG world-building
        among GMs is the excellent book{" "}
        <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348791/worlds-without-number">
          <em>Worlds Without Number</em>
        </a>{" "}
        by the brilliant{" "}
        <a href="https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/pages/about-us">
          Kevin Crawford
        </a>
        . While it's an incredible TTRPG in its own right (and definitely worth
        checking out), its GM-focused content is among the best in the industry.
        A generous free version, containing 90% of the content, is also
        available{" "}
        <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition">
          online here

        .

        I'm a huge fan of the random tables in this book. Most of them are
        system-agnostic, and Crawford even encourages using the world-building
        content for other systems (see page 220). I created this website to make
        using these random tables simpler and faster, helping GMs focus on
        building fantastic worlds and RPG settings.

        I primarily made this website for myself, but I figured others might
        find it useful as well. The code for the website can be found{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/jdglaser/ttrpg-generators/tree/main">
          here
        </a>{" "}
        and the code is open source under the{" "}

        . If you notice any issues feel free to open up an issue on GitHub and I
        will do my best to take a look (but no promises, I am a full time
        software engineer and dad ðŸ™‚). I also plan to add more tables from the
        book and features to the site. If you have ideas, feel free to share by
        opening an issue on GitHub.

      <h2>Usage Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Open the menu in the sidebar and select a category. On first opening the
        page, random results will be rolled on each table. Clicking the
        "refresh" button will refresh all table results

        style={{ border: "1px solid black", maxWidth: "100%" }}
        src={tutorialOne}
      ></img>
      <p>
        Each bolded bullet point is the header for one of the tables found in
        the book. Clicking any of the individual table headers will reroll just
        that table.

        tables in rich text format for pasting in rich text editors like Google
        Docs or Microsoft Word
