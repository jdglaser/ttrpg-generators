d8 Church Structures
1 Each holy man or woman is the autonomous
leader of their own branch of the sect, with
however many followers they can gather.
2 There are multiple pontiffs, friendly or otherwise,
with subordinate clergy obedient to their own
pontiff and perhaps cooperative with others.
3 There is a single pontiff with a layer of upper
clergy and temple heads beneath them, who
have a layer of minor clergy serving them.
4 Individual congregations are independent, with
their clergy subject to the consensus will of their
parishioners.
5 Powerful lay believers fund temples that are
subject to their familyâ€™s wishes, staffed by clergy
supported by their funding.
6 There is no official clergy; some believers may
take up special roles or provide teaching, but
they are not qualitatively different from others.
7 The church is entirely part of the secular structure
of the land, its clergy no more than officials
appointed by the government to their roles.
8 Roll twice; the faith has different structures in
different places or contexts.
